This is a customizable baseball scoreboard project.

This tool allows you to create, manage, and display the detailed real-time status of a baseball game. It's ideal for simulating games, tracking local leagues, or serving as a front-end interface for any baseball-related application.

## Key Features

* **Team Scores:** Freely set the current scores for both the home and away teams.
* **Game Innings:** Easily update the current inning (e.g., Top 5th, Bottom 9th).
* **B/S/O Count:** Track the real-time count of Balls (B), Strikes (S), and Outs (O).
* **Base Status:** Clearly display which bases are occupied (1B, 2B, 3B).
* **Full Control:** Manually adjust all stats at any time to reflect the game's state.
